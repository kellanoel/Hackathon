# Hackathon
These are two websites on opposite sides of the spectrum. One of them displays insults whilst the other display compliments. One of the themes of this challenge was to make something new and small. Whilst the idea itself may not be a relatively new idea, we spun the concept so that the insults would appear to be small whilst the compliments larger.
        This is symbolic of the fact that insults, and by extension negativity, are all small and insignificant in the grand scheme of things and should not be focused on." Don't sweat the small stuff".
